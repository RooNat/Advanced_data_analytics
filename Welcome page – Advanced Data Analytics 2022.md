## Content

-   This unit extends the material taught in the co-requisite unit 'Introduction to Data Analytics' by giving students a solid grounding in contemporary advanced machine learning. In visual analytics, such methods serve to as useful tools to change the data representation, e.g. through dimensionality reduction, or as a way of analysing visual data) in a framework of statistical pattern recognition; in text analytics, such methods serve to produce powerful analyses that traditional methods fail to deliver. The unit also covers some more advanced techniques and analytical approaches to information visualisation.
    
    Machine learning topics covered by this unit include: principles of Statistical Pattern Recognition (probabilistic models for data, curse of dimensionality generalisation error, bias-variance dilemma); linear models (Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis; Discriminant Analysis); generalised dissimilarity mappings and neighbour embedding techniques; Gaussian Processes; latent variable models (Gaussian Mixture Models, Generative Topographic Mapping and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model); Bayesian model regularisation and combination; feature selection; challenges of large datasets and potential solutions. The text analytics part focuses on current approaches using deep learning, along with crowdsourced data annotation.

    Asynchronous content will be released weekly, usually by 09:00 on the Monday morning of each week of teaching. My intention is to release all material for week N in week N-1 (so the first material is available the week before term starts). 
    
    Lectorials will take place on Tuesdays at 12:00-13:00 MVB 1.11 and labs take place on Fridays 15:00-18:00 in MVB 2.11. There will be drop-in sessions with the unit director every week but at variable times (due to my other duties as Head of School). They will take place on Teams and the times will be provided in advance. Note that the sixth week of the course is a reading week, with no new material delivered. That is not included below.
    
    Any variations to this schedule will be posted here.
